At the beginning of each chapter, we will outline for you the learning goals and\nobjectives that should be accomplished once you have gone through the chapter.\nWriting computer programs requires not only mechanistic thinking but creative problem\nsolving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about\nsolutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of\nlearning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem solving skills."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Activity\n\n1. *Why\tdo\tyou\tthink\tuderstanding\tcomputer\tprograms\tis\trelevant\tin\tour\ttime\ttoday especially\tin\tthe\tnew\tnormal?*\n\n    * Computer Programming nowadays are in demand because we are in  the Digital Age.
